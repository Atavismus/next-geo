# next-geo
Prototype made for testing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [CountryAPI](https://countryapi.io/).

It was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It also uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

Hosted on Vercel [here](https://next-geo-thomas-projects-961bf831.vercel.app/) (unless it has been removed).
